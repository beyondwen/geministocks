1. "targetPriceRaises" — analysts/institutions raising target prices or price forecasts, especially in clusters
2. "consensusBullish" — crowded unanimous bullish language ("all analysts agree", "strong buy consensus", price targets chasing price)
3. "goodNewsFatigue" — stocks/indices failing to rally on good earnings or positive news (buyers exhausted)
4. "institutionalRetreat" — funds/insiders reducing positions while ratings stay bullish
5. "externalBlame" — narratives blaming declines on external factors (deleveraging, rates, war) while avoiding fundamentals

For EACH signal give: strength 0-100 (0 = absent, 100 = pervasive across many items) and one-sentence evidence in ${lang} citing which news items support it (or state it is absent).
Then give "newsScore" 0-100: the aggregate crowding/euphoria level implied by this news window (high = crowded consensus + top signals present; low = fear/neutral/no signals). Be conservative: sparse or ambiguous evidence must yield low strengths.

2. "marketPanic" — markets actually selling off or panicking in response to trade threats (not generic volatility)
3. "walkback" — softening: pauses, exemptions, "great deal" announcements, deadline extensions, retreat from threats
4. "complacency" — markets/commentators explicitly IGNORING or dismissing threats ("markets shrugged off", "investors have learned", muted reaction to new threats)
5. "tacoMentions" — media explicitly naming/discussing the TACO pattern or trade itself ("TACO trade", "Trump always chickens out", "buy the tariff dip" as known strategy)
